    Everyone has a copy of the most up-to-date blockchain ledger on their
    computer. Blockchain records cannot be changed or deleted. If someone were
    to hack a single user’s ledger and make a change, that change would have to
    be reflected in every following ledger. In order for a blockchain database
    to be compromised, a hacker would have to hack every user’s copy of the
    ledger at the same time.
    <br></br>
    This is a monumental—and practically impossible—endeavor.
    <br></br>
    It also means that the more participants in a given blockchain network,
    the more secure that blockchain is.

    If Bob had tampered with the ledger to make it look like he was the owner
    of the house, when in fact he was not, the rest of the network would reject
    the sale of the house because he was not the rightful owner, per their copy
    of the ledger.
