              Alice and Bob’s agreement is communicated out to the blockchain
              network. Without blockchain, middlemen from a title company would
              need to be involved to prove Bob’s ownership. But thanks to
              blockchain Bob’s proof of ownership was recorded to the blockchain
              ledger when he originally purchased the house.

              The records on blockchain are securely distributed and transparent
              to all participants in the network. As a result, the network itself
              can (automagically) validate that Bob is indeed the owner.
