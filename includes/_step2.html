              Once Bob gives the green light for the transaction to occur, this transaction
              is communicated out to the rest of the participants in the network. Because
              everyone shares a copy of the latest blockchain ledger being used, they can
              check to make sure that the transaction is valid.

              In other words, if Alice had tampered with Bob's blockchain ledger to incorrectly
              show that she had a cookie—when in reality she did not—other people in the
              network will be able to see that and they will reject the transaction.
