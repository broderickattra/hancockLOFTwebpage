    Say Alice wants to give Bob a cookie in exchange for a hug.
    Bob is going to need proof that Alice has a cookie to give in the first place.
    Because Blockchain keeps track of every transaction every made within the network,
    Bob can check to see that at some point in the past, Alice received a cookie
    from someone else and has not yet spent it.
