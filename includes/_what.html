            So far that just sounds like any other database, right? Well, what makes
            Blockchain so revolutionary is that it’s <strong>distributed</strong> as opposed to
            centralized or decentralized.

          When a change is
          made, it’s communicated to the rest of the network so that every
          participant has a copy of the most up-to-date record book.
        </br></br>
          This makes it a very secure and trustworthy system, without the need for
          a middleman with singular authority over the database.
        </br></br>
          By being completely distributed and transparent, blockchain databases create
          trust in a trestless environment.
