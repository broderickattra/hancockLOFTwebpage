        Think of a blockchain database as a record book that keeps track of every
        transaction made within a network. As new transactions occur, they are
        validated and then added to the record book.
      </br></br>
        So far that just sounds like any other database, right? Well, what makes
        Blockchain so revolutionary is that it’s distributed. When a change is
        made, it’s communicated to the rest of the network so that every
        participant has a copy of the most up-to-date record book.
      </br></br>
        This makes it a very secure and trustworthy system, without the need for
        a middleman with singular authority over the database.
      </br></br>
        By being completely distributed and transparent, blockchain databases create
        trust in a trestles environment.
