        <span class="bold">Think of a <span class="blockchain" style="text-transform:lowercase">blockchain</span> as a record book that keeps track of every
        transaction made within a network.</span> As new transactions occur, they are
        validated and then added to the record book.
      <br></br>
        So far that just sounds like any other database, right? Well, what makes
        Blockchain so revolutionary is that it’s <strong>distributed</strong> as opposed to
        centralized or decentralized.

      When a change is
      made, it’s communicated to the rest of the network so that every
      participant has a copy of the most up-to-date record book.
    <br></br>
      This makes it a very secure and trustworthy system, without the need for
      a middleman with singular authority over the database.
    <br></br>
      By being completely distributed and transparent, blockchain databases create
      trust in a trestless environment.
