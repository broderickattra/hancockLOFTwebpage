        Think of a blockchain database as a record book that keeps track of every
        transaction made within a network. As new transactions occur, they are
        validated and then added to the record book.
      </br></br>
        So far that just sounds like any other database, right? Well, what makes
        blockchain so revolutionary is that it’s distributed. This means makes it
        a very secure and trustworthy system, without the need for a middleman with
        singular authority over the database.
      </br></br>
        By being completely distributed and transparent, blockchain databases create
        trust in a trestles environment.
