  This new ledger is given its own unique ID as well as the unique ID of the
  ledger that it just replaced. In this way, every new ledger is linked to the
  one before it, creating the blockchain.

  This chain is immutable. If someone were to hack a single participants ledger
  and make a change, that change would have to be reflected in every subsequent
  ledger that came after it. On top of this, the hacker would have to achieve the
  same thing for every single participant in the ledger—all before the next
  update occurs.
</br></br>
  This is a monumental—and practically impossible—endeavor. It also means that
  the more participants in a given blockchain network, the more secure that
  blockchain is.
